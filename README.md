# Pacman Factory
Pacman factory creates Pacmen, adds them to the DOM, and increases the speed/movement of the Pacmen with the click of a button. The Pacmen use the image under the images folder in the main directory. To use this on your own machine, download the source files, and open the index.html file in your browser. From there, you can use the two buttons provided to add Pacmen, and increase their speed. 

In the future, I would like to:
 - add ghosts which disappear once a Pacmen hits them
